# CSV_reader_Csharp
Coding test terminating the first module "Basi Della Programmazione" of the course "Programmatore Plurilinguaggi" in Ancona.
The program reads a CSVc containing data about geometrical shapes, copies its content into a struct and then a library I created recognizes the characteristics of the shape and calculates its area.
